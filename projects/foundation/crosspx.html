                        <p class="margin-16">One of the ever-prevalent challenge faced by doctors and patients alike is the lack of time. Holistic care starts from early diagnosis, pervading through effective treatment and culminating at patient education to keep disease at bay. A lot of digital health startups in India and US with point solutions lack interoperability and standardization to address the significant issues like accessibility, quality and timely care.

                                <br><br>A robust care continuum not only covers all these checkpoints, but it also minimizes the time in achieving them.</p>

                        <p class="margin-16">Along with the project managers, I went back to the drawing board, kept the two most essential stakeholders, i.e. doctors and patients in the middle and built a whole solution around them. It means living every eventuality of a patient ranging from doctor discovery, longitudinal records maintenance to lack of post-visit feedback while creating the mind map.
                            <br><br>Then I went to the other side of the table and thought of every problem a doctor faces, ranging from patient acquisition, workflow management to lack of standard documentation. See: <a href="crossdx.html"><font color="E16261">RoundGlass Cross Dx</font></a></p>

                                Healthcare is for everyone. So, one of the biggest challenges that I faced while designing this application was to consider the needs, expectations and the behaviour of all the age group possible: Minors, college students, working professionals/adults and senior citizens.
                        </h3>
                        <p class="margin-32-24-24">
                                I participated with project managers and a UX researcher to conduct user interviews to understand the user’s pain points and frustrations with the current healthcare system. A focussed group session with different age groups helped us to gather their demands and expectation from a personalized healthcare solution. We also approached some doctors to comprehend as to what would be the ‘right’ healthcare platform for their patients, the one that ensures better care delivery through connectivity and collaboration. All of these crucial insights bolstered us to plan the adequate amount of features & offerings in our application to capture that right holistic healthcare platform.

I used zeplin as the collaboration tool to handover the designs for production. Jira platform was used to track this cycle of design handoffs, bug fixes and improvements.
