                        Is the GCC fashion e-commerce attractive enough for a new player?

                            </h3> 
                        <p class="margin-16">Compared to global standards, GCC consumers are “underserved” on online offerings, especially on product and service quality. Several gaps in the consumer proposition of existing players have led to a fragmented market which leaves a room for a new player. Growth here is driven by very high internet penetration and young, digitally engaged demographic. Online spend by this demographic is significantly high (Ex: Avg online monthly spend in UAE: 1400-1600 AED, in Saudi Arabia: 900-1100 SAR)

                                <br><br>And with the Landmark group's capabilities in this region, STYLI stands to benefit massively from it in targeted customer marketing, product sourcing, supply chain and partner ecosystem.</p>

                            <br><br>2. Prompt Delivery and easy return were a major pain point. Consumers are looking for seamless fulfilment experience.<br><br>3. Localization matters and customers trust ‘local’ companies more.<br><br>4. Great user experience – design/ease of navigation & relevant search result is also important to consumers.<br><br>5. New/ trendy products matter - consumers are looking for new/unique designs.<br><br>6. Products with minimum quality promise (sizing/fabric/fitting) are important.

I joined the organization in mid-October to lead the design efforts and work closely with the business & product management team to plan the product roadmap for the next 1 year. I was also responsible(later on) for building & managing a small design team of 3 people which included a UX designer, a creative designer(social media) and an illustrator.

Over next few weeks, I conducted a design audit exercise to pinpoint the flaws in our current app & the overall product strategy so far, as it didn't seem to align with the broader objectives of the business. This compelled us, i.e the product & design team, to submit a new roadmap which outlined many tangible (both short & long term) goals for the next 1 year.
